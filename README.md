## General Information
- This is a programming assignment part of a course. 
- Build a multiple linear regression model using advance regression to identify the significant variables in determining the price of houses.
- Identify the optimal value of alpha for Ridge and Lasso models.

## Conclusions
- Best Alpha for Ridge: 20
- Best Alpha for Lasso: 0.001
- Ridge model seems to be the best choice out of Linear, Ridge and Lasso

Based on the Ridge model, top 5 Features which describe the SalePrice are:
- Overall Quality type "Very Excellent"
- Neighbourhood type "Old Town"
- Neighbourhood type "Northridge Heights"
- Overall Condition type "Poor" which doesn't seem appropriate and need more investigationÂ¶
- Garage Area

## Technologies Used
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, SKLearn
